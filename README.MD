Hello there!  
In this project i took the challenge to build a client and a server communicating with unix signals.
(We can use SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2)

I also built a ACK-system in there so if a bit goes missing it will actually stop transmissing.  
Feel free to learn how I did things by peaking into my code.

Final Score: 110%
(Bonus: Implement a small ACK system)

If you have questions hit me up on intra: jfritz
